# Expected outcome

* System Design Specification (SDS)
    * One document containing the text, reasoning, do's and dont's
    * Communicate with team members and stake holders
* You have a system to build - create a highlevel plan
* Plan your system and its subsystems,
    * choose your architecture 
    * create a blueprint of your system-to-be

</script>



<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Target audience

* Teammates
* Stakeholders
    * Project managers
    * Unit managers
* Customer
    * The orderer who pays the bill
    * The user

</script>



<script data-role="slide" data-markdown type="text/html">
# Split Analysis and Design

* Analysis
    * Sketch the system, without any thoughts of the target environment where it should be implemented

* Design
    * Select a target environment for the analysed system and make it fit

> Separate Analysis (highlevel system) from Design (target environment) to make it easier to communicate.

> Compare to database ER modelling.

# Architecture patterns

* Layered architecture

# Layered architecture

> Multitier architecture is a client-server architecture in which presentation, application processing and data management functions are physically separated.

> The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three-tier architecture.

# Event-driven architecture

> An event-driven system typically consists of event emitters (or agents), event consumers (or sinks), and event channels.

# Space-based architecture

* Architecture pattern for applications that have variable and unpredictable concurrent user volumes.
* Designed to address and solve scalability and concurrency issues
* Interact by exchanging tuples/entries via one or more shared spaces

# 4+1 Architectural View Model

> A model to make several drawings to understand the system.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 4+1 Architectural View Model

>  "Describe the architecture of software-intensive systems, based on the use of multiple, concurrent views".

> The views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# 4+1 Architectural View Model

* Logical View
* Process view
* Development view
* Physical view
* Scenarios

# 4+1 View Model...

* Development view
    * Show subsystems/components known to the programmer.

> The “4+1” view model is rather “generic”: other notations and tools can be used, other design methods can be used, especially for the logical and process decompositions, but we have indicated the ones we have used with success.

<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# System analysis and design

* Fundamental structure of a software system
    * software elements
    * relations among them
    * properties of the elements/relations
    * usage of the system
    * data/events in the system
    * interfaces and sub modules
* A blueprint for the system

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Start with analysis

1. Understand the system to be built
1. Explain the system
1. Sketch the system
1. Create a SDS document as an understanding and conclusion of your work 

> Make it happen is more important than making it right.

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Hints

* Create the SDS document and make it your work area where you document and agree on the system
* Follow the 4+1 model?

* Write to someone who are on a slightly lesser level than youreself in understanding the system

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Proceed with design

1. Divide into sub systems and explain/draw each
1. Decide on the users and the interfaces
1. Decide on the implementation techniques
1. Explain choosen technologies and note what other techniques you evaluated
1. Complete the SDS document as an understanding and conclusion of your work 

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# The SDS

* Is about making fundamental structural choices
* Facilitates communication between stakeholders
* Captures early decisions about the high-level design
* To hold on to as the project goes on

> "What did we write in the SDS about this?"

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# How to draw

* Make each picture tell a well defined story
* Several small pictures might build a better story then one large and complex picture
* Make it look good

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Tools

* Polya's Problem Solving Techniques
* Top-down and bottom-up design
* Flowchart
* Pseudocode
* Class diagram
* Use case diagram 
* Entity relationship diagram

# Summary

* What is a System Design Specification (SDS)
* About software architecture patterns
* How to think about analysis and design
