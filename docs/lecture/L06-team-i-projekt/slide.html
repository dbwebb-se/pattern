# 10,000 fold difference

> "A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer. - Bill Gates"

> "Great Programmer Productivity - Accounting for 10,000 fold difference?"

# One solves it all

* One person might be the difference between success and failure?

# Top performant

> This degree of variation isn't unique to software. 

> A study by Norm Augustine found that in a variety of professions -- writing, football, invention, police work, and other occupations -- 

> **the top 20 percent of the people produced about 50 percent of the output**,

> whether the output is touchdowns, patents, solved cases, or software (Augustine 1979).

# Top performant

> ...As I reviewed these citations once again in writing this article, I concluded again that they **support the general finding that there are 10x productivity differences among programmers**. The studies have collectively involved hundreds of professional programmers across a spectrum of programming activities. 

(A Deeper Dive Into the Research Supporting “10x”, McConnell)

<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Big difference

> A genuinely terrible programmer can have sub-zero productivity (the bugs they introduce take longer to fix than it would take to just do all of their work for them).

> And a genuinely great programmer can do things that poor and average programmers would simply never achieve, regardless of how much time you gave them.

# Dangerous to be a x10

* All focus on you
* All work on you - or how to divide the work?
* All questions on you
* Making you a manager or team leader
* Burning you out
* Will the team survive without the x10?

# Seattle with the good, not great

> "Most employers of programmers would be better off with a good programmer rather than a great one, because the great one will just get bored and leave. Gotta find a good match between programmers and jobs."

# The 10.000 rule

> If an individual spends 10,000 hours of full concentration and intense effort in their certain skill, they will become an expert at it. (Gladwell)

</script>



<script data-role="slide" type="text/html" data-markdown>
# Deliberate practice

> People believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults. 

> We deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. 

> We argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.

(K. Anders Ericsson)

#  Five whys

An iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem

The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" five times. 

The answer to the fifth why should reveal the root cause of the problem.
